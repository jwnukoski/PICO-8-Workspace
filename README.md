# Pico-8 Workspace
Workspace for creating Pico-8 games.

## Setup
1. `git clone` this repo into your Pico-8 carts directory. Linux's default directory would be `/home/user/.lexaloffle/pico-8/carts/`. For example, after cloning you would have a `/home/user/.lexaloffle/pico-8/carts/workspace` directory.
2. Launch Pico-8.
3. `cd workspace`.
4. `load [cart name]`.
5. `run`.
